# Keylogger Project

## Overview
This project implements a basic keylogger using Python. A keylogger is a tool that records the keystrokes of a user on a system for various purposes such as monitoring or debugging. **Use responsibly** and only with proper authorization!

## Features
- Records all keystrokes on the system.
- Stores keystroke data in a text file for later analysis.
- Optionally sends logs via email or uploads them to a server (if implemented).

## Installation
To set up and run the keylogger, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/KeyloggerProject.git

### Additional Steps:
- **Add a `requirements.txt`** file if your project has dependencies.
- **Replace "your-github-username"** with your actual GitHub username and customize any part as needed.
  
Once you have this `README.md` file, you can upload it to GitHub by either using `git` commands or manually adding it through the GitHub web interface.
